# Exploring Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN)

Gravitational wave detection has significantly advanced our comprehension of the universe, revealing deep insights into some of its most potent and mysterious phenomena.  

In this study, we propose a novel method employing **Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs)** to classify gravitational wave signals into binary categories. Our objective is to illustrate the efficacy of QCNN architectures in precisely identifying these cosmic signals.  

While conventional approaches have predominantly used classical algorithms, our research seeks to evaluate the performance and potential benefits of QCNN architectures in the realm of gravitational wave detection.  

QCNNs utilize quantum mechanical principles like **superposition** and **entanglement** to execute computations beyond the capabilities of classical networks. We introduce **thermal noise** into the data, assess its effects, and subsequently remove it using **Wiener filtering** and **Bayesian inference techniques**.  

We thoroughly examine these denoising strategies to identify the most effective method for noise elimination. Through comprehensive analysis and meticulous experimentation, we investigate the unexplored potential of QCNNs in signal classification tasks, thereby contributing to the advancement of techniques in gravitational wave detection.
